# Impacts of Globalization on Food 
# [Data Story](https://adamanteam.github.io/Data-Story/)
# Abstract
  With the fast growth and democratization of transports, the food we eat everyday no longer depends on the local production but tends to come from various parts of the globe. Using the Open Food Facts Dataset, our goal is to discover and analyze the various impacts of this food globalization.
  
  Our project will mainly focus on important actual issues regarding its ecological and health aspects. We will first get more insights about the food transportation process, about its origin and destination and the ecological footprint of this transportation. We will then get to find how food affects our health by comparing the food consumption of countries to their global health indicators and look for the effects of this uniformization of food consumption.

# Research questions
- How does the globalization impacts the food quality (based on a nutrition score) for countries like France or Switzerland ?
- How does the food we eat affect our Life expectancy ? 
- Is there a relationship between the wealth of a country and its food quality ?
- How much do the food travel before reaching the countries we study ?

# Dataset
## [OpenFoodFacts](https://fr.openfoodfacts.org/data)
  We want to use the Open Food Facts database dataset. This dataset provides different tags that will help us to classify countries into exporters and importers depending on the food.  
  Main tags used: 
  - "origins of ingredients"
  - "place of manufacture" 
  - "countries where the product is sold"  
  - "nutrition score"  
    
This will help us to perform some estimations on the travelled distance of the food. However, the majority of the data that comes from this dataset is from France. This especially affects the origins and places where the food is sold. Therefore, we decided to focus on France and in addition Switzerland for answering our research questions. 
  
## [Gross Domestic Product per country (in $)](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.mktp.cd) and [Life Expectancy](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.IN)
  We want to use statistics from the [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/) in order to relate the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the Life Expectancy or other values with our data. The most recent and complete data is taken.
